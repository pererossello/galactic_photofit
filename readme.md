# Photometric Decomposition of UGC09629

## Authors
Pere Rosselló

## Overview
This project revolves around the photometric decomposition of the galaxy UGC09629. It was initially developed as part of the subject "Física Extragaláctica" within an astrophysics program. The focus lies on unraveling the physical characteristics of UGC09629 through photometric analysis.

## Directory Structure
Here's a brief description of the repository structure:

- `bin/`: Houses FITS files, configuration data, and Jupyter notebooks for various tasks like fitting and plotting. Also includes utility Python scripts.
    - Subdirectories include `archivos_galaxias` and `figures`, among others.
- `code/`: The main codebase. Contains Jupyter notebooks for fitting, plotting, and comparison, along with utility Python scripts.
    - Notable subdirectories are `extra/` and `plots/`.
- `data/`: Contains FITS files and example data for reference.
- `figures/`: Stored visualizations, including plots and comparison metrics.
- `results/`: Contains stored results, mainly as .nc files and .txt files detailing parameters and differences.

## How to Run
- You'll need to have Python installed, along with some specific packages.
- Navigate to the `code/` directory for the core codebase.
- Run individual Jupyter notebooks for specific tasks like fitting or plotting.

## Special Mention
- `init_imports.py`: Initializes all imports.
- `utils.py` and `plot_utils.py`: Utility scripts to ease the process.

## Contributing
Feel free to fork and submit pull requests. For bugs and feature requests, please create an issue.

## Additional Resources
- `class_notes.md` and `some_notes.tex` in `extra/` folder provide extra information and details.

This project is really about taking the fuzzy dots we see in the sky and transforming them into hard numbers and comprehensible data. Because let's be real—nobody likes an inscrutable galaxy.

And that's the skinny of it. Feel free to dive in!
